\section{Introduction}
Data centers use about 1\%-4\% of the electricity in the world\textsuperscript{\cite{rivier2013electricity}}. Using energy more efficiently is one of the fastest, most cost-effective ways to save money, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs, and meet growing energy demand. This project aims to minimize the total energy cost for a set of data centers by determining the optimal power consumption from renewable energy sources and the power grid.To get started, please provide a CSV file containing information about the data centers, such as their distances to renewable energy sources and their maximum power consumption. You will also be asked to input any restrictions on the Grid Power and Renewable Power limits.
The program will then process the input data, set up an optimization problem, and solve it using a linear programming approach. The resulting optimal power consumption for each data center will be displayed, along with the total cost of the energy. A plot illustrating the relationship between the distances to data centers and their optimal power consumption will also be provided for further analysis.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

{The purpose of this document is to provide a analytical model of allocate the computing power to each data center with minimize the cost to program users (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  This document should clearly
communicate all necessary background information and detailed system context is described in Section 3.}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

 {The domain of this problem is restricted to given renewable energy pricing and factory electricity loss proportionate to transmission. In particular, different areas will have varying electricity pricing and distinct types of renewable resources. However, we can set constant renewable pricing and minimize the total cost to determine the optimal computing distribution plan for each data center. The domain focuses on one specific type of input data: the distance between the data center and the power station. In this program, specifically, we will identify the optimal cases of combination under static pricing. Therefore, it has been decided to use distances as input. Subsequently, since this project is limited to any renewable energy with a given price, any transmission power loss of renewable energy is considered out of scope. Essentially, while this program is intended to eventually be used within the context of specific physical data, it is developed and constructed for application to another area in North America as well.}  

%{The scope section is related to the assumptions section(Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and describes, all of the assumptions.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

{This document assumes the intended reader has familiarity with basic optimization analysis, power system analysis, and electricity distribution analysis. Courses which contribute to background knowledge may be titled Linear Systems (undergrad), Electric Machines and Power Systems (undergrad), Electric Power Transmission, Distribution and Utilization (undergrad). Data constrain and model limitation will be discussed in this document. However, our exposition will only cover the concepts needed for our purposes. For proofs and for a complete exposition of all background materials. Furthermore, this document will explain as entry as possible aiming to appliable for more readers.}


\subsection{Organization of Document}

{This document is built on the template recommendations in \href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate}{cas 741} github that seeks to standardize communication tools for software development. The suggested order for reading this SRS document is: Goal Statement, Instance Models, Requirements, Introduction, and Specific System Description.}

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level

specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{This model is intended to estimate the minimum cost with different computing distributions of data centers with different distances from electricity power station} \\

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}\label{ssc:terminology-definitions}
\label{ssc:TM}

 {The minimization problem involves finding the lowest possible value of an objective function while taking into account the constraints imposed on the problem. The ideal value is the minimum value of the objective function, which lies within the feasible region defined by the problem's restrictions. To better understand the problem, one can construct a graph representing the feasible region, which visually displays the viable combinations of variables. By examining this feasible region, it is possible to determine the optimized distribution of computing resources that adheres to the given constraints. }




\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

{Physics system will regarding to real world. HVDC transmission losses are quoted as less than 3\% per 1,000 km\textsuperscript{\cite{rosellon2003different}}, a formula was designed to calculate the total power lose along the transmission line. With various of distance as input, the system operation like a net flowing. Each data center will consuming electricity from both renewable resources and grid power station. In the model, only transmission along electricity grid will assume have power lose, renewable resource stations are assuming very close to the data centers the supplied.  }

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure2,
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item Data centers are not uniformed in the area.

\item Renewable resources stations are very close to the data centers they supplied.

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction
  in abstraction is possible through invoking referencing Assumptions. This section collects the laws and equations that will be used in building the
instance models.

\subsubsection*{Detailed derivation of calculating power transmission losses}

{It is fact that the unit of electric energy generated by the power station does not match the units distributed to the consumers. Some percentage of the units is lost in the distribution network. This difference in the generated \& distributed units is known as transmission and distribution losses. Distribution Sector is considered the weakest link in the entire power sector. Transmission losses are approximately 17\% while distribution losses are approximately 50\%. In this model, we assume all of the data centers pass through the same number of sectors, so only transmission line losses are calculated.}

\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

{The Data Definitions are definitions of symbols and equations that are
  given for the problem.  They are not derived; they are simply used by other
  models.  For instance, if a problem depends on density, there may be a data
  definition for the equation defining density.  The DDs are given information
  that you can use in your other modules.}

{All Data Definitions should be used (referenced) by at least one other
  model.}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.  {Modify the examples
  below for your problem, and add additional definitions as appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

{The motivation for this section is to reduce the problem defined in
  ``Physical System Description'' (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}) to one
  expressed in mathematical terms. The IMs are built by refining the TMs and/or
  GDs.  This section should remain abstract.  The SRS should specify the
  requirements without considering the implementation.}

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goals {reference your goals} are solved by {reference your instance
  models}.  {other details, with cross-references where appropriate.}

  appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

{The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and instance models with each other.  Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on the assumptions.}
